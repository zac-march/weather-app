The weather forecast web application is a project that has been developed to provide users with an easy and convenient way to access weather information for a specific location. The application utilizes a weather API to fetch weather data and has implemented functions to process the JSON data, returning only the relevant information needed for the app. The UX has been enhanced through responsive design and dynamic styling based on weather data, such as weather-related gifs, which add an element of fun and visual appeal.
